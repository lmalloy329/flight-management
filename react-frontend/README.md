FLight Management Application

This application was built using Java and Spring on the backend and React ont he front end. To begin using this application please intialize a schema labeled: flight_management_schema then you can run the Springboot Application. This application will create all the databases as well as use the data seed to fill create data such as Airports, Flights, Aircraft and 2 customers.
tAfter the databases have been intialixed and the backend is running you can access the terminal in react-frontend and run the command

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Once the front end has started you have 3 options you can sign in as one of our two premade customers or register yourself as a user.

If you sign in using Lmalloy329@gmail.com Password: 1234567 you can access all of the employee functions.

This app was built using Create-React-App to create the basic structure.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
